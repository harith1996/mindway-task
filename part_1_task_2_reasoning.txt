Feature importance:
    - most important: sum_stakes_liveaction
    - model dependent 
    - chosen models : Random forest classifier, XGBoost classifier
    - why not logistic regression class?
        - does not deal with NaN
        - need to impute:
        - can't take avg of whole dataset, it would be unrepresentative
        - what about avg of game types? - still may not be representative
        - might need another model itself to impute the missing values
    - best method: run multiple models and see which common feature they see as important
